        <p class="quote">"The song ‘How You Get the Girl’ is a song that I wrote about how you get the girl back if you ruined the relationship somehow and she won’t talk to you anymore. Like, if you broke up with her and left her on her own for six months and then you realize you miss her. All the steps you have to do to edge your way back into her life, because she’s probably pretty mad at you.<span class="bold-text"> So it’s kind of a tutorial. If you follow the directions in the song, chances are things will work out.</span>" -Taylor Swift, 2014 </p>
        <p></br>In celebration of Taylor Swift's iconic 1989 album and its Taylor’s Version release, I've envisioned a captivating music video concept for one of my favorite tracks from the record. “How You Get The Girl” has always had a special place in my heart for the unique journey it takes listeners on. Inspired by the pop perfection that Taylor masterfully crafted, I imagined a visually enchanting video that translates the sonic brilliance into a lighthearted and entertaining experience on screen. Join me on a whimsical adventure that mirrors the magic of the music, capturing the essence of this beloved track in a vibrant and joyous visual spectacle.</p>
        <p></br><span class="bold-text">WHERE: </span> NYC. I think we can all agree that 1989 is THE New York City girl album so the setting for such an iconic anthem from the album needs to reflect that.</p>

        <p></br><span class="bold-text">WHO: </span>  Girl (who got her heart broken by boy), Boy (who was responsible for said heart breaking), and Taylor Swift as the mischievous, all knowing, love loving Cupid.</p>
            
        </p></br><span class="bold-text">WHAT: </span>  Following the storyline in the song, a boy professes his love to a girl from his past and begs her to take him back. Cupid Taylor is the narrator / storyteller.</p>

        <p class="bold-text">SYNOPSIS: </p>
        <p></br>Cupid taylor walks on a cobblestone street. Scene starts with just the shoes on cobblestone and the sounds of New York meshing with the sounds of the steps. </p>
       
        <p class="song-lyric"></br>[Intro]</p>
        <p>When the intro of the song starts, Cupid Taylor is seen in full walking towards the camera. Close up of Taylor as she tells camera / audience to come in closer with the “come here” finger gesture and “look over there” while pointing towards a boy standing on the stoop of an apartment with a bouquet of flowers looking nervous. </p>
       
        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Verse 1]</br>
            Stand there like a ghost</br>
            Shaking from the rain, rain</br>
            She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
        </p>
        <p>Show a closeup of the boy standing outside the door nervously shifting getting ready to knock on the door with flowers in hand. The girl opens the door and looks shocked when she sees the boy. She says “are you insane?” in time with the song.</p>
    
        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            Say it's been a long six months</br>
            And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want
        </p>
        <p>Back to the boy,  saying the same thing as the lyrics. As he’s saying them, the girl crosses her arms and walks away into her apartment while the boy follows after. </p>
       
        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Pre-Chorus]</br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you get the girl</br>
            And then, you say   
        </p>
        <p>Camera angle shows him facing the camera walking inside revealing Taylor right behind him on the stoop. She waits a second before entering herself. Closeup of Taylor smiling and singing “and then you say” while closing the door. </p>

        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Chorus]</br>
            I want you for worse or for better</br>
            I would wait forever and ever</br>
            Broke your heart, I'll put it back together</br>
            I would wait forever and ever
        </p>
        <p>Now show the boy and girl in the apartment while the boy begs for her back (while saying the same thing as the lyrics) and the girl looking so over it.</p>

        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you get the girl, girl</br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you get the girl, girl
        </p>
        <p>This part of the chorus focuses on Taylor singing the lyrics.</p>

        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Verse 2]</br>
            Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah</br>
            With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks</br>
        </p>
        <p>Back to girl & boy. Boy is trying to remind her of the good ole days. Taylor helps by pointing her finger and making a “cloud-flashback bubble” appear with a quick montage of their past when they were in love.</p>

        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh</br>
            When you left her all alone</br>
            And never told her why, why
        </p>
        <p>Bubble is still there but this time the happy moments turn sour as it shows when the boy left her. He sees her looking sad at the bubble and notices the memory. He pops the bubble in a slightly irritated way while Taylor just stands slightly behind it (but still next to him) looking suspiciously innocent (”who, me?” kind of vibe). </p>

        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Pre-Chorus]</br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you lost the girl</br>
            And now, you say
        </p>
        <p>Taylor singing this lyric while looking a little uncomfortable/awkward but in a humorous way. </p>


        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Chorus]</br>
            I want you for worse or for better</br>
            I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)</br>
            Broke your heart, I'll put it back together</br>
            I would wait forever and ever
        </p>
        <p>Back to boy & girl, now boy is saying these lyrics again while chasing after girl who is quickly gathering her things into her bag and walking out the door.</p>


        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you get the girl, girl</br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you get the girl, girl</br>
            Yeah, yeah

        </p>
        <p>Back to Taylor following them while singing the lyrics, making sure to turn off the lights and shut the door. Taylor follows behind them walking down the street very happily as the girl walks angrily and the boy follows, pleading with her.</p>


        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Bridge]</br>
            And you know</br>
            That I don't want you to go
        </p>
        <p>Boy reaches for girl’s wrist to turn her to face him. Girl stops and turns around abruptly because of this and takes her arms away putting them up next to her head (in the “stay away, I don’t want anything to do with you” way). She says the lyrics “you know that I don't want you to go” while saying the first part very convictively while faltering and looking sad and defeated at the “to go” part. </p>


        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Breakdown]</br>
            Remind me how it used to be</br>
            Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
        </p>
        <p>Boy takes this as his opportunity and pulls out an old folded up picture of them kissing on the cheek (polaroid/old film looking pic/photo booth strip) and shows her. The picture turns to real life (like the moving paintings in harry potter) showing the actual moment. Girl looks confused but emotional at the picture (can’t believe he kept it) then looks up to him. </p>


        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            And say you want me
        </p>
        <p>Closeup of boy’s face looking right in the camera saying “I want you” before going to a view of both of them while he takes her hand to hold and she lets him.</p>


        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            And then you say
        </p>
        <p>Taylor sings this line whilie smiling slyly standing between and before them like an officiator of a wedding.</p>

        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Chorus]</br>
            I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)</br>
            I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)</br>
            Broke your heart, I'll put it back together</br>
            I want you forever and ever (I would wait forever and ever)
        </p>
        <p>Boy leads girl down to the end of the street where a parade appears coming down the cross street with Taylor leading it. Girl and boy happily run and join the parade hand in hand looking really happy. </p>


        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)</br>
            I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)</br>
            Broke your heart, I'll put it back together</br>
            I want you forever and ever (I would wait forever and ever)</br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you get the girl, girl (This is how it works)</br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you get the girl, girl (Get the girl)</br>
            (That's how it works)</br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you get the girl, girl</br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you get the girl, girl
        </p>
        <p>Grand finale is them joining the parade in the street in a horse drawn carriage with taylor next to them (all three squeezed in). Taylor sings the parts in parentheses. </p>

        <p class="song-lyric"></br>
            [Outro]</br>
            And that's how it works</br>
            That's how you got the girl
        </p>
        <p>Closeup of girl’s face as she sings last line into the camera “And that's how it works” then she looks at the boy and they both smile at each other. Camera pans to Taylor right next to them while she sings into the camera “That's how HE got the girl”. Taylor smiles and winks before it cuts to black.</p>
