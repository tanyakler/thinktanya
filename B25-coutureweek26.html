            The excitement of catching a glimpse of the iconic Schiaparelli keyhole cutout, taking in the mystical worlds Chanel transports us to, or being moved by the humble bow from Jonathan Anderson at the finale of the Dior show are what make this week such a divine treat. Haute Couture Week allows us the privilege to bask in the glimmering talent and immense artistry that couture houses are built on. We get to see some of the most creative minds tell their stories through movement, texture, color, and emotion. These shows bring us to the wild and imaginative inner workings of Daniel Roseberry, Jonathan Anderson, and Matthieu Blazy to name a few. Some of the greatest artists in fashion making their mark on the biggest couture houses in Paris.</br>            
            </br><span class="bold-text">the agony and the ecstasy.</span>
            </br>The only agonizing part of this show was the fact that I couldn’t see it in person. Schiaperelli. Daniel Roseberry. The names speak for themselves. Truly never one to disappoint, Roseberry always delivers the most effeminate and moving shows of all the couture houses. This was no exception. Inspired by the work of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, Roseberry was inclined to create a collection that made him feel. He recalls a moment when seeing the ceiling where “thought stops. Feeling begins.” Inspired by this, his collection is an ode to the feeling behind creation rather than how it looks. A beautiful perspective that yields a beautiful collection. <a href="https://schiaparelli.com/en/pages/haute-couture-printemps-2026" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Schiaparelli SS 2026</a></br>

            </br>“Florals? For spring? Groundbreaking.” Well if Jonathan Anderson is behind it then it most certainly is. And humor me on this title please, thank you. With the way he effortlessly exuded the heart of Dior with a modern lens into his first couture collection, I’m led to believe that Dior is in his soul if not his name. This collection was so masterful that you might have a hard time believing it was Anderson’s first foray into the haute couture world. Inspired by nature and its “systems in motion – evolving, adapting, enduring” and how haute couture mimics that same logic, Anderson created a vibrant, modern, and extremely cohesive collection that championed natural forms, marvelous wonders, and emotional sparks. A true feat. <a href="https://www.dior.com/en_us/fashion/womens-fashion/haute-couture-shows/haute-couture-spring-summer-2026-show" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Dior SS 2026</a></br>
            </br><span class="bold-text">a very blazy chanel debut.</span>
            </br>Anything but the typical runway, the radiant pink mushroom wonderland Matthieu Blazy transported us to for this collection was just breathtaking in and of itself. And the looks that graced it were just as awe inspiring. And very Chanel. We saw the classic Chanel staples like tweed, feathers, embellishments, but in a lighter more buoyant take. Everything felt effervescent, like it might just float away at a moment’s notice. With mushroom and avian motifs across details in almost every look, the soft and gentle break of spring was finely embedded into this collection. A stunning display that leaves me eaglerly anticipating how Blazy will continue to blossom at Chanel. <a href="https://www.chanel.com/us/haute-couture/spring-summer-2026/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Chanel SS 2026</a>
