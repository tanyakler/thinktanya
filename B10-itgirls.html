        <p>The phrase “it girl” is tossed around a lot when describing some of the most prominent girls in the pop culture scene. But what exactly defines an it girl? Is it their attitude, what they’re doing, how they conduct themselves, what they wear, or some combination of it all? I believe that being in the public eye exposes them to a level of scrutiny that, although unbearable for most, these girls gracefully navigate, exuding a nonchalant confidence that further draws people in and solidifies their status as it girls.</br>
        </br>For the most part, I think we can all agree on who comes to mind for it girl status. When I think of current it girls I think of Olivia Rodrigo, Tate McRae, Ayo Edebiri, and Reneé Rapp to name a few. They are all in the limelight right now for their career successes and overall admired by many for their realness. I think everyone has their own personal list of it girls who they love to keep up with, who inspire them, and who just embody IT. Here are some of my it girls through the years:</br>
        <br><ul>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Sabrina Carpenter: </span> This girl never misses. I first noticed Sabrina Carpenter during her Disney days in "Girl Meets World" and with the release of her single "Can't Blame a Girl for Trying." However, it was her dedicated pursuit of a music career that truly elevated her to it girl status in my eyes. Her pop persona shines through flawlessly in albums that I can't get enough of. Beyond her musical talent, her impeccable wardrobe is a perfect match for her popstar princess image—every outfit she wears is a ten. If I could switch closets with anyone, it would be her. The abundance of pinks, sparkles, and hearts in her tour wardrobe is so on-brand and fun. With a hit album, sold-out tours, an opening act slot for The Eras Tour, a perfume line, and a genuine personality showcased on social media, Sabrina Carpenter is someone I love to see in the spotlight and a true it girl.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Bridgit Mendler: </span> Bridgit Mendler's journey is nothing short of remarkable. From portraying the studious older sister, Teddy Duncan, to embarking on a short yet sweet music career, pursuing higher education at MIT and Harvard Law, and ultimately becoming a CEO in Palo Alto, she has conquered every side quest you could imagine. Her acting career kickstarted with the lovable lead in "Good Luck Charlie," stealing our hearts with her down-to-earth charm. While her debut album "Hello My Name is..." remains an often overlooked treasure, songs like "Ready or Not," "Hurricane," and "5:15" form a holy trifecta that deserves more recognition. Bridgit then chose to step away from the spotlight to pursue academic aspirations, earning a PhD at MIT and studying law at Harvard. Now, as the CEO and Co-Founder of Stealth in Palo Alto, California, she continues to shine in her own realm. Despite stepping out of the public eye, Bridgit Mendler, adorned with achievements like a modern Olympian, remains an everlasting it girl in my eyes.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Aly & Aj: </span> Their hit songs “Potential Breakup Song,” “Like Woah,” and “Chemicals React,” in addition to their recurring roles in cult classic Disney Channel Original Movies, cemented Aly & AJ as the cool girls of my childhood. After a brief hiatus from my radar, their return to the music scene with the 2023 "With Love From" album reignited my love for them. Seeing them perform live at Northeastern in April 2023 during their tour was so surreal. After all those years, my childhood idols had aged so gracefully and still perfectly embodied the it girl aura from their Disney days.</li></br>
        </ul>
        While this list is in no way comprehensive of every it girl that has inspired me through the years, it encapsulates a few through the years who captivated me for various reasons, leaving lasting impressions. The most important part of the it girl label to me is the fact that the it girl is always doing what she loves and is passionate about while always staying true to herself. There’s truly nothing cooler or more inspirational than that.</br>
