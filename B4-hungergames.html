    <section class="blog-body">
        <p>In the midst of this Hunger Games renaissance, it's time for me to confess my unwavering love for the franchise that began in 2011 when, as a fifth-grader, I delved into the first book. Since then, not a week has passed in the last 12 years without the Hunger Games crossing my mind in some way. I compare random occurrences in my days to arbitrary scenes from the series. I rewatch the entire series 2-3 times a year. I mourn Finnick quite regularly and question the need to gruesomely kill one of the most charismatic and adored characters of all time. Wherever I am physically, my mind often finds itself in Panem.</br>
        </br>Suzanne Collins created one of the most powerful social commentaries of our age. With the release of the highly anticipated prequel, "Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes," the initial trilogy gained even more strength. The character progression and world-building in the prequel were exceptional, and its riveting ending left me unable to tear my eyes away from the final pages. While I don’t believe the movie adaptation perfectly matched the brilliance of the book, it added another layer to the series, making the experience of a new installment after so many years nostalgically exciting. </br>
        </br>In celebration of the resurgence of this unparalleled dystopian franchise, let's dive into some of my favorite things about the series:</br>
        <br><ul>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Finnick Odair: </span> I don’t know if I’ve ever been more impacted by a character death than Finnick’s. I was choking back sobs in the theater after his final scene in Mockingjay Part 2. From his very first line, the iconic "sugar cube?" Finnick, exuding charm and charisma, quickly became a fan favorite and left a lasting impact on both characters and viewers alike.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Yellow Flicker Beat: </span> Jennifer Lawrence delivering one the best final scenes in all of cinema before cutting to black and showing a flash of the mockingbird pin as the first notes of "Yellow Flicker Beat" by Lorde start? That is perfection.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Effie Trinket: </span> While not without her faults, Effie has some of the best character growth in the series. Her upbringing in the Capitol was embedded into her being throughout the series; nevertheless, her loyalty and devotion to Katniss were unwavering in every aspect. In the finale of the series, while she doesn’t outright join the forces of the Capitol or District 13, she stands by Katniss no matter what. My favorite line in the series is delivered by her. When she tearfully sees Katniss off in the final book, she tells her, “Promise me you find it, the life of a victor.”</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Effie Trinket's Wardrobe: </span> How can we not discuss one of the most lavish and outlandish wardrobes of any fictional character to date? I mean, the Met Gala theme even incorporated one of her most iconic looks for promotion. In a stark contrast to the drab attire worn by those in the districts, Effie’s ensembles were consistently flamboyant and extravagant. Some of her most iconic looks were plucked straight off the runway of none other than Alexander McQueen. The specific dress for the Sleeping Beauty themed Met Gala, in question, was the Monarch Butterfly McQueen from the Spring/Summer 2011 collection that Effie wore in the reaping ceremony in Catching Fire. My personal favorite Effie Trinket look was the pink McQueen dress from the Fall Winter 2012 collection that she wore on the Victory Tour in Catching Fire.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">The Soundtrack: </span> The songs created for this series are like no other including not one, but two of my favorite Taylor Swift songs ("Safe and Sound" and "Eyes Wide Open") along with "Red Yellow Flicker Beat" (as I mentioned before, but it deserves a second shout-out), "Atlas," and "Can't Catch Me Now.”</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Foreshadowing: </span> The subtle nods to Katniss throughout "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" were so satisfying to watch, knowing what’s to come in the original trilogy. The immediate hatred Snow has for the mockingjays, Lucy Gray writing the Hanging Tree song, and Lucy Gray escaping Snow at the end to find Katniss root all serve as poignant reminders of the fate of Snow and Panem. These elements seamlessly intertwine with Snow’s story, never once taking us out of his narrative.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">A Very Specific Scene from Mockingjay Pt 1: </span> One of my favorite scenes in the franchise is in Mockingjay Pt 1 where Katniss gets on the hovercraft to see district 12 for the first time and the camera focuses in on Boggs as the score swells. It's so powerful.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">“there are worse games to play”: </span> Even just typing it makes me tear up. This haunting final line of the series is a tear-inducing masterpiece, a testament to Suzanne Collins' exceptional storytelling.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Katniss & Peeta: </span> The evolution of their relationship is a captivating journey—from allies navigating the games and striving to keep each other alive, to forging a friendship, blossoming into lovers, enduring a period of enmity, and ultimately embarking on the gradual path back to trusting each other. No one could understand what these two have been through except each other, and despite the Capitol's attempt to weaponize Peeta, which nearly shatters them both, the subconscious vow made in the first games to safeguard each other withstands the test of time.</li></br>            

        </ul>
        </br>As I revel in the return of the best dystopian franchise, the characters and narrative in this beloved franchise continue to make the Hunger Games an enduring part of my life, a testament to its timeless impact.</br>
