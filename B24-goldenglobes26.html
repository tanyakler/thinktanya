            Awards season is officially upon us, which means we’re getting into some of the biggest nights in fashion. With the Golden Globes this past Sunday, we saw some great looks but also a lot of playing it safe in my opinion. Here’s what I think: it’s an award show. A red carpet, for crying out loud. Where’s the fun? Where’s the excitement? I get that this isn’t the Met Gala, but it’s still a big night where everyone will be scrutinizing what you’re wearing, so I really appreciate when stars do show up and show out. </br>
            </br><span class="bold-text">the LBD of it all:</span>
            </br>I saw a lot of black dresses. Don’t get me wrong, a little black dress is timeless of course, but we’re talking about the Golden Globes. Let’s play with some color! Now, some of these looks brought the fun through texture, silhouettes, and embellishment, but all in all, I still would’ve loved to see a more colorful array of stars. </br>
            </br><span class="bold-text">stars in black who DID impress me:</span>   
            </br>Since I’m feeling magnanimous, the following get a pass from me for wearing black.</br>
            </br>Lisa in Jacquemus - I just love the flowy, boho silhouette on this with the sheer black on top, and paired with the bold Bulgari choker, this is definitely an awards show-worthy look.</br>
            </br>Miley Cyrus in Saint Laurent - Miley knows how to do an award show. I don’t think I’ve ever been disappointed by any of her recent awards show looks. She knows what she’s doing, and this Golden Globes look was no exception. The exaggerated, fanned out shoulders, the all over sequins, and the sunglasses all came together so perfectly for her. I love it. </br>
            </br>Mary Beth Barone in Todd Oldham - A gorgeous silhouette, fun beaded textures, and the plunging neckline with a bedazzled strip across the top came together so beautifully in the look. I mean, it’s also Mary Beth Barone. She can do no wrong. Even if I absolutely hated her dress, she’d still get a pass after her exquisite work of red carpet interviews.</br>
            </br>Jenna Ortega in Dilara Findikoglu - There’s nothing basic about this look. It's perfection. The shape, the beading, the Jenna Ortega-ness of it all. Wow. Just wow.</br>
            </br><span class="bold-text">men in black:</span>
            </br>Jacob Elordi in Bottega Veneta - So I wasn’t planning on talking about men in this because they really do have a way of disappointing me at award shows and I didn’t want to get into it, but I couldn't resist. I mean it’s Jacob Elordi. The glasses gave him this pass from me. </br>
            </br>Timothee Chalamet in Chrome Hearts - Timothee on the other hand… will not be getting a pass. The chrome hearts did nothing for me. This is a pretty important awards season for him, so I'm hoping for better come the Oscars.  </br>
            </br>Damson Idris in Prada - LOVED his Met Gala look so I had high hopes for this one. Nothing crazy going on here, but I will say the satin bowtie and blue shirt saved his look for me. Sometimes it really is just the little details that are make-or-break.</br>
            </br><span class="bold-text">honorable mentions before we get to my top 3:</span>
            </br>Zooey Deutsch in Prada - Saw a few black and white combos and this was by far my favorite, expecially with the black embellishing contrasting the white pleating. Gorgeous.</br>
            </br>Tessa Thompson in Balenciaga - sleek, sparkling, and the PERFECT green. Loved it.</br>
            </br>Emma Stone in Louis Vuitton - love the color and love the satin top and embellished skirt combo. Just love it.</br>
            </br><span class="bold-text">ok now the top 3:</span>       
            </br>Brittany Snow in Danielle Frankel - SO I know this isn’t over the top, extravagant like I was asking for earlier, BUT this is how you do sleek and simple. The movement on this dress was unreal and the sheer white overlying the dramatic mermaid silhouette of the dress is what made this a standout. Just ethereal.</br>
            </br>Leighton Meester in Miu Miu - I am so obsessed with everything going on in this. The neon pop at the top in contrast with the rest of the beautifully sequined pale pink was gorgeous, fun, and just what a red carpet look should be: elegant yet exciting. And the simple sleek silhouette really let the bold texture and color be the stars of the look. No notes.</br>
            </br>Kate Hudson in Armani Prive -  Oh. My. God. This was one of the best looks I’ve ever seen her in. Like I may even venture to say it tops THE yellow dress. The draped fringe silhouette, the diamonds, the bright silver, THE FRINGE? It’s unreal. This is absolutely my best-dressed for the night.</br>
            </br></br>Before I sign off, I would be remiss if I didn't share some of my favorite accessories of the night: Mary Beth Barone’s perfect delivery of every single very sincere question she asked, the Heated Rivalry Duo’s charming award show debut, and MOST importantly, Mark Ruffalo’s commitment to using the carpet as a stage for speaking up on pressing matters. More of that please, thank you.</br>
