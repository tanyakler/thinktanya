        <p>One rule I've picked up from my extensive TikTok scrolling is this: never skip a Jon Bellion "making of" video. The first time one popped up on my For You page, I plunged down the rabbit hole, spending hours engrossed in similar videos on YouTube. For the uninitiated, Jon Bellion stands as one of the most gifted singer-songwriters and producers of all time, comparable to musical Midas Ryan Tedder. Bellion's influence extends behind the scenes, shaping hits for Justin Bieber, Maroon 5, The Jonas Brothers, Selena Gomez, Halsey, Katy Perry, and more, while also cultivating his own meticulously crafted and coherent discography.</br>
        </br>My journey as a Jon Bellion fan began years ago when I first heard "Guillotine." Its clever wordplay and irresistibly catchy melody immediately catapulted it into my list of favorite songs. Throughout my freshman year of college, his albums "Glory Sound Prep" and "The Human Condition" served as my coding companions for Computer Science classes. The closing track of "The Human Condition," titled "The Hand of God," stands as one of the most remarkable compositions ever. By sampling each song from the album, "Hand of God" brings the entire collection to a close in a sonically seamless and emotionally moving manner.</br>
        </br>Despite my familiarity with his work, it's surprising that I only stumbled upon one of the "making of" videos a few weeks ago. In these vulnerably captivating videos, Bellion's artistry, genius, and passion take center stage. He often begins with a hook, bassline, or drumbeat, building layers and introducing musicians one by one to contribute their ideas. The viewer witnesses the evolution of lyrics, the birth of iconic lines (like the personal favorite, "there's bones in my closet but you hang stuff anyways" from "Guillotine"), and the collaborative process as he assembles a studio full of musicians, vocalists, and accompanists. The result is pure magic – a final product that seamlessly melds diverse sounds into a cohesive masterpiece.</br>
        </br>What stands out most is the infectious joy radiating from Bellion as he immerses himself in the creative process. Whether it's his genuine happiness or love for the craft, it permeates through the screen, spreading to every musician involved and even reaching the viewer. Watching these videos never fails to elicit a beaming smile from me. Bellion brings unadulterated joy and a profound love for his craft into the creative space, and the immediate reciprocation of these feelings by everyone he collaborates with is a rare gift that deserves recognition.</br>
