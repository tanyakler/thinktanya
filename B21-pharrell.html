        </br><p><span class="bold-text">A: Easy. Pharrell.</span></p>
        </br><p>I’m just in awe (and majorly envious) of how freely he creates. The freedom he has to pursue and bring to life every one of his wildest dreams and ideas is nothing short of magical to me. Whether it’s through music, film, or fashion, he’s constantly innovating and proving again and again how powerful art is in all its forms. He has the Midas touch across every creative avenue and continues to be a defining force across industries.</p>

        <span class="bold-text">7. Maggie Rogers NYU</span><p>I’ve probably contributed to 40% of the views on that YouTube video. Anytime it shows up on my screen, I have to watch. Let’s set the scene: Maggie Rogers is a student at NYU, taking a music production class. One day, one of the biggest names in music walks in to critique student work. Nerve-wracking doesn’t even begin to cover it. She plays "Alaska" (a personal favorite of mine), and history is made. Pharrell’s reaction? Instantly iconic. From the first few seconds, he’s visibly floored—his expression says it all. You can literally watch his brain light up in real time. It’s magic. He recognizes Maggie’s brilliance from the jump and makes sure his admiration is known. Real recognizes real. Seriously, I’ve linked it <a href="https://youtu.be/G0u7lXy7pDg?si=Rul63FeeqzKzxY5z&t=1234" style="color: #FF3FC9; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">here</a>. Do yourself a favor and watch.</p>

        <span class="bold-text">6. His LEGO Biopic</span><p>I watched this a few months ago and still think about it a few times a week. What I would give to have been in the room when Pharrell pitched this: a lego movie biopic. I can’t think of anyone else who could pull that off. The film doesn’t just do such a great job telling his story, but It also highlights just how expansive his mind is as a creative. <em>Piece by Piece</em> does such a brilliant job of capturing his journey—from his childhood in Virginia Beach, growing up as a quiet, curious kid, to becoming one of the most influential and genre-defying artists in the world. It’s not just a documentary; it’s an art piece in itself. What really struck me is how deeply personal and intentional every part of the film is. It’s a full-circle look into how Pharrell’s mind works—layered, playful, thoughtful, visionary. You see how his creative process isn't just about making music or clothes or movies; it's about building worlds. The fact that it’s all told through LEGO animation only reinforces how expansive (and wild) his creativity is. It’s rare to watch something that feels like a direct portal into someone’s brain—but that’s exactly what this film is.</p>

        <span class="bold-text">5. His Jukebox Musical (aka <em>Despicable Me</em>)</span><p>We don’t talk about this enough: Despicable Me is one of the most iconic animated franchises of our timeand Pharrell is a huge reason why. His soundtrack strikes the perfect balance: playful without being childish, emotional without being cheesy. His music gives the films a cool, unexpected edge that elevates the entire experience and appeals to a broad audience. Songs like "Happy" didn’t just support the movie, they became cultural moments in their own right. Pharrell gave the franchise a distinct sound that’s fresh and unforgettable.</p>

        <span class="bold-text">4. Louis Vuitton Head of Menswear</span><p>On top of all his music accolades, Pharrell now holds one of the most coveted positions in fashion. Someone from outside the traditional fashion system running one of the most iconic houses? Unheard of.</p>
        </br>And he’s killing it. He brings showmanship, world-building, soundscapes, craftsmanship, and storytelling into each collection. His shows are always a highlight of Fashion Week, turning every runway into a full-on experience.</p>
        </br>From his debut show that turned the Pont Neuf Bridge into a gold-gilded runway, to his most recent at Place Georges Pompidou (where I used to take my lunch breaks when studying abroad!), each show explores a theme that comes to life conceptually and physically.</p>
        </br>His latest collection, inspired by the game Snakes and Ladders, transformed the Pompidou plaza into a life-sized board game designed by architect Bijoy Jain of Studio Mumbai. Pharrell also produced, composed, and/or wrote <em>all</em> the music in the show.</p>
        </br>If there’s one thing Pharrell knows how to do, it’s put on a show—a complete sensory experience of visual, musical, and emotional brilliance.</p>

        <span class="bold-text">3. The LV Speedy</span><p>I’ve never been huge on monograms, so the Speedy was never <em>that</em> bag for me. Its significance as one of Louis Vuitton’s most iconic staples wasn’t lost on me—I respected it for its legacy, but it just wasn’t love. Then Pharrell gave it a makeover. In his debut collection, he reimagined the Speedy in bright colors, luxe textures, and new sizes, bringing it back into full cultural relevance. A perfect example of his Midas touch: refreshing something classic without erasing its essence.</p>

        <span class="bold-text">2. His Collaborations</span><p>One thing Pharrell is known for is pushing boundaries. From fashion to music, he is always thinking outside the box with his creative explorations. Some of my favorite examples of that are his musical collaborations. One that completely caught me off guard (in the best way) was his song "Good People" with Mumford & Sons.  If you’ve made it this far, you already know how I feel about Pharrell, but something you might not know (that you should) is that Mumford & Sons is one of my all-time favorite bands. So this pairing felt like a special little gift for me. And it did not disappoint. Blending their signature sounds into something totally unique, "Good People" is a perfect example of how genre-bending collaborations can result in something fresh and beautiful. Honorable mention: the “LV Bag” collaboration featuring Don Toliver, j-hope, Pharrell, and Speedy. Yes, he dropped a song about one of his own bags and had it as a featured artist. Iconic.</p>

        <span class="bold-text">1. "Get Lucky"</span><p>The intro to this song (and "Style" by Taylor Swift) could wake me from a coma. Arguably his most iconic collaboration, this is what put Pharrell on the map for me. Sure, Pharrell had been a major force in music long before this, but hearing "Get Lucky" on the radio in 2013 stopped me in my tracks.</p>
        </br>Something about him and Daft Punk creating this funky, futuristic dance hit just clicked. It’s held up beautifully over the years and still feels ahead of its time. So it’s only right for this song to take the top spot.</p>

        <p>Pharrell is someone who brings his visions to life with such clarity that allows the rest of us to experience the inner workings of his mind seamlessly. He’s an innovator, a visionary, a true artist in every sense.</p>

        </br><p>Forever breaking the mold and forging his own creative path, Pharrell Williams is a creative force to be reckoned with and someone who will always inspire me to create boldly, freely, and without hesitation.</p>
