    <section class="blog-body">
        
        <p>On the dawn of a new year it’s easy to look forward to what you want to accomplish in the new year that you haven’t yet while neglecting celebrating the ups and downs of the year we are putting to bed. While it’s only natural to look forward with excitement and hope of what’s to come, it’s equally as important to celebrate the wins and losses we’ve experienced understanding that every trial and tribulation from the year past make up for who we are.</p>
        </br><p>So let’s look back on 2024. I personally started the year several months into the post grad job search even more confused on what I was looking for then when I started. Instead of living in constant state of uncertainty over what the future would hold I decided to just take it one day at a time and view my time living with my family back at home as a gift. With my “everything happens for a reason” mantra to guide me, I started the year with a change of perspective that brought a lot of growth and gave me the right mindset and attitude which led to me landing a role in Boston in February. My mantra proved to be true as the timing of my offer couldn’t have been more perfect. I got the call while with one of my best friends and waiting on the arrival of the others. After celebrating with friends that weekend and family back in Pennsylvania, I had to mentally and physically prepare to move back to a city I thought I had closed the door on in 2 weeks. While I wasn’t sure if Boston was where I wanted to go post grad, I am so grateful I got to return to a city very dear to my heart and continue to explore, meet new people, have new experiences, and build a deeper connection with.</p>
        </br><p>Tasting true independence again living in the city and working a job I was starting to really love was amazing. The months flew by. I continued seeing my old friends often while making new friends and living in a part of the city I hadn’t experienced before. There was a lot more new than I was expecting for a city I had been in for 4 years prior.</p>
        </br><p>The summer brought classic Boston experiences that only deepened my love for the city and also a magical trip to my favorite city right before the Olympics, a bucket list experience for sure.</p>
        </br><p>A beautiful Bostonian Fall was much anticipated, very busy, and full of love. From showing my slice of suburban Pennsylvania heaven to my best friend, to a weekend in a dream city celebrating another best friend running a marathon, to having so many of my closest friends old and new together for my birthday, Fall was idyllic.</p>
        </br><p>Which brings me to 24: the age. As the oldest of my friends, I find it very daunting to be the first to add another candle to the cake. While normally the harmless jokes and teasing tend to harbor under my skin, this year brought a perspective shift. Being the first to enter a new age means that I’m the one setting the example. Is it exciting? Is it scary? Is it confusing? Is it all of the above? I get to decide and set the standard, and I decided that every year added is one more year lived and another one to live. It means we are alive and how could that be seen as anything less than spectacular.</p>
        </br><p>After a little family Vegas ft Grand Canyon trip solidifying my love for the Wild West, the year came to a close, bringing a much needed respite and time home for the Holidays.</p>
        </br><p>All that’s to say, one of the biggest lessons of 2024 for me was that your perspective on life is more than just an attitude but more so the mental environment you will live in. Cultivating and spending the time to truly strengthen your perspective to look on the bright side will drastically change the day to day world you live in.</p>
        </br><p>So thank you 2024 for the lessons, the battles, the growth, the joy, the love, and above all, further proof that this really is a beautiful life. On to the next…</p>
