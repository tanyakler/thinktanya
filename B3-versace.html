        <p>Dear Versace, </br>

        </br>A phenomenon I've noticed in my life is that in every photoshoot, magazine, fashion week, exhibit, and award show I view, the looks that always make me do a double take and nearly bring me to tears are the ones so magnificently crafted by Versace. In fact, there's a section of my brain, one I use quite frequently, purely devoted to immortalizing these creations.</br>
            
        </br>One, in particular, I dream about several times a day, was at the Love Brings Love: Alber Elbaz tribute show at la Palais Galliera in Paris while studying abroad in 2022. This exhibit showcased looks created by 46 fashion houses and designers taking inspiration from Alber Elbaz and his great legacy. The look in this beautiful show that impacted me more than I ever believe a dress has was this incredible sparkly fuchsia mini dress with emphasized shoulders inspired by Alber’s vibrant personality and his signature draped sleeves. To this day, I have found it hard to find a dress that recreates the emotional response this dress instantly evoked in me. More than simply creating a gorgeous glimmering pink dream of a dress that that thousands, myself included, would die to wear, while absolutely capturing the essence of Alber Elbaz, Donatella Versace understood the assignment and payed homage to Elbaz in the most authentic and beautiful way by effortlessly infusing the essence of her own brand with Alber Elbaz’s legacy.</br>
            
        </br>Versace has taken my breath away countless other times, including moments that have become iconic in pop culture. One example of this is how Versace so expertly meshed with Barbie-mania in the July 2023 Vogue cover look featuring Margot Robbie in a satin “Barbie pink” dress with flower embellishments. To no surprise, my favorite looks in this feature were the two Versace ones including the cover and a hot pink two-piece set with black floral beading.</br>
            
        </br>And finally, what would an ode to Versace even be without mentioning one of the most iconic red carpet Grammy’s looks of all time? I know what you think I’m going to say: the green deep plunge dress that J.Lo donned in 2000. While definitely a historic look ahead of it’s time, the tropical look is not the one I’m referring to. The Grammy’s dress that lives rent-free in my mind is the ethereal pink diamond butterfly dress worn by Dua Lipa at the 2021 Grammy’s. From the glittering diamonds all over and the silhouette of the butterfly down to the crystal antennae on the neck to the perfect shade of baby pink, mesh bottom, and high slit, the details on this dress really highlight the superior attention to detail and craftsmanship in the Versace house.</br>
            
        </br>In parting words, Versace has been such a significant part of my fashion journey and helped me realize how strongly fashion can leave an imprint on my life. It’s been a pleasure to have Versace shape my love for fashion and inspire me in so many ways, and I cannot wait to see the future looks that will absolutely blow me away and remind me of why I pursue my fashion dreams.</br>
        </br> Love, Tanya.</p>
