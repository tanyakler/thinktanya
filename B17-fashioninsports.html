    <section class="blog-body">
        <p></br>Let me start this with an obligatory “Go Birds!” Now that that’s out of the way, Happy Victory Monday, aka day after Super Bowl Sunday, aka day after my beloved Eagles demolished KC in a glorious 40-22 blowout. After having just lived one of the biggest days in American Sports, I think it’s an apt time to talk about an aspect of sports that is often overlooked, fashion.</br>
        </br>Fashion is a vessel through which pop culture moments effortlessly travel. The Super Bowl, and sports in general, are strong examples of that. From game day outfits of star players, to over the top fan costumes, to the mega industry of sports merch, there are so many way that fashion infiltrates the industry.</br></p>
        </br><span class="bold-text">THE WALK IN:</span><p>Starting with athlete fashion, many big shot players use their game day walkouts to showcase their personal style. Knowing they’ll have many cameras on them, many athletes use the walk from bus to stadium as a mini red carpet to dress up for. While dressing up on game days is a mark of polished professionalism, it is also a great way for athletes to boost their confidence by wearing what they feel the most confident and powerful in and mentally prepare for the game ahead of them.</p>
        </br>On some of the biggest days of their lives, one of the many important decisions athletes must make is what they will wear to the game. Take Travis Kelce in his burn orange sequined suit and Patrick Mahomes in an Eagles Midnight Green colored suit at this year’s Superbowl. Both very calculated outfits that were meant to make a statement on the biggest days of their career. Kelce hoping to establish himself as a fashion forward player with his nod to the very classic seventies style and Mahomes hoping to cause a stir in his cocky display of wearing his opponent’s colors hoping to cement his status with a three peat. On the winning side, Eagles QB Jalen hurts arrived looking regal in a tailored royal purple suit with his personal phrase used on his apparel “Breed of One” embroidered on the collar. DeVonta Smith also went for a rather regal look, in a slim fitted red suit with a royal gold insignia embroidered on the front.</br>
        </br>Beyond the athletic stage, some star players have really embraced their sense of style by unabashedly diving headfirst into the fashion realm. Jayson Tatum at NYFW, Odell Beckham Jr attending the Met Gala, Roger Federer being a co-chair of the Met Gala, and Joe Burrows at Vogue World are just a few examples where we see high profile names in the sports world sauntering into high profile events in the fashion world blurring the lines between the fields and red carpets entirely.</br>
        </br>Many athletes have embraced their role in fashion by investing in brand partnerships or launching their own brands. David Beckham Is a prime example as he has expanded his empire on the soccer field to the fashion universe through his plethora of partnerships, collections, and personal brands including his partnership with Tudor Watches, Adidas, Hugo Boss, and his personal eyewear brand, EYEWEAR by DAVID BECKHAM.</br>
        </br><span class="bold-text">FAN FASHION:</span><p>Even though they won’t be stepping on the field, you’ll always find fans wearing jerseys of their favorite players. While jerseys are classic and pretty tame options, many fans go the extra mile and take their outfit to represent how deep their team loyalty really runs.</p>
        </br>Sporting events are great opportunities to flaunt your team pride but also showcase your sense of style with how you incorporate your team into your outfit. Strategically layering color and logos is the most common way, but some fans go above and beyond wearing mascot heads or painting themselves with their team colors.</br>
        </br>Fashion is also engrained deep into the history of teams themselves. In a sea of eagles fans you’ll notice something interesting, a large majority of fans are wearing a color jersey that doesn’t always quite match the players’. This brighter hue, named Kelly Green, is the color the Eagles used to wear in the 90s. Since then the midnight green shade has become the only representation of the team until 2023 when they reintroduced the Kelly Green jerseys for players, having the team wear them for 2 home games during the season. Rooted in nostalgia, these 'Kelly Green Weeks' fostered a lot of excitement among the fan base as it referenced an era of football for the Eagles that a generation of fans had not experienced in years. The simple swap of a jersey color can create such an exciting and emotional response from fans showcasing the deep emotional tie that fashion has in sports.</br>
        </br><span class="bold-text">WEARING YOUR TEAM:</span><p>When thinking about where to buy sports memorabilia, the first places you probably think of are Dick’s Sporting Goods, Fanatics, or Rally House. These are businesses that specialize in all things sports and pretty much set the standard for sports merchandise, raking in billions of dollars yearly. In recent years however, more fashion companies have capitalized on the success of sports merchandise and launched their own merch collaborations with various national sporting organizations. Abercrombie has an official collaboration with the NFL bringing football logos to cardigans, jackets, and sweaters, pieces you wouldn’t necessarily find in a typical sports shop. These collaborations make sports team merchandise more easily accessible to a new audience. People who generally shop at stores like Abercrombie may not be the same people shopping at Rally House, therefore introducing sports memorabilia that matches what they would more typically wear allows for a broader client base for sports merchandise. There has also been an increase in more one off brands who are specifically creating more fashionable and unique sports merch prioritizing the fashion and streetwear aspect more than traditional shirts and jerseys that just have a team logo. This opens the door for more people to rep their favorite team without sacrificing their sense of style.</p>
        </br>The recent World Series was another huge moment for fashion in sports due to the high profile pairing of the L.A. Dodgers vs the New York Yankees. These two extremely fashion forward cities were pitted head to head with both teams duking it out on the field leaving their fans to duel it out in the stands and through fashion. Brands and fashion houses capitalized on this matchup with multiple big name collaborations coming about. With strong East Coast roots, Ralph Lauren pledged their loyalty to the Yankees through an exclusive partnership bringing the team logo to popular preppy brand pieces. Madhappy, a brand born in Los Angeles, remained neutral catering to their bicoastal audience with a collection for the <a href="https://madhappy.com/collections/yankees" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Yankees</a> and a collection for the <a href="https://madhappy.com/collections/dodgers" style="color: skyblue; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Dodgers</a>. Fans of both teams didn’t have to stray from their roots or personal styles to show their loyalty.</br>
        </br>Fashion and sports are some of the largest most lucrative industries in the world, raking in billions and fostering a global audience so it only makes sense for them to go hand in hand. While it may not be as important as the playbook, the role of fashion in sports is stronger than many would first think and will only get bigger. As we see more athletes step into their personal styles, partner with big fashion houses, and come out with their own collaborations and brands, we’ll start to see their influence surpass merely living on the field and start to infiltrate into the ever evolving and fast paced fashion space.</br>
