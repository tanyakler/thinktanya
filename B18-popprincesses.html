        <p>The role of the Pop Princess holds a significant position in pop culture and the music industry as a whole, with the title constantly changing as new artists emerge to claim the throne. Besides being multitalented singers, songwriters, and performers, a Pop Princess is authentic to who they are. They aren’t trying to fit into a mold but instead are being themselves thus finding the audience that resonates with their most authentic self. They don’t dilute themselves to appeal to the masses, they create what they want and put on the persona they want which attracts the people who truly understand and resonate, leading to genuine relationships with their fanbases.</br>
        </br>In my eyes, becoming the Pop Princess requires being the most talked-about pop singer at any given time. Once you've held the title, it's yours forever, though someone else will eventually step into the spotlight. The cycle constantly repeats.</br></p>

        <span class="bold-text">Tate McRae: the EDGY-DANCE POP PRINCESS</span><p>This all stems from the release of Tate McRae’s new album “So Close to What,” which I can’t stop listening to. Considering I never went out of my way to listen to Tate, the chokehold this album and the "Revolving Door" music video has on me currently was unexpected to say the least. This effect is the definition of Pop Princess. From acclaimed late-night show performances to pure pop perfection (and controversial) music videos, impossible dance TikTok trends, and her highly anticipated tour, Tate is impossible to ignore right now.</p>

        <span class="bold-text">Sabrina Carpenter: the SHORT, SWEET, & CHEEKY POP PRINCESS</span><p>While Sabrina has been a Pop Princess for me for years with her initial albums, I think her current "Short n' Sweet" era is when she really took the throne in everyone’s eyes. You might argue that the "Emails I Can’t Send" tour propelled her, and I would agree, as her cheeky nonsense outros really garnered attention all over the internet. That set the stage perfectly for her ascent to the throne. After the EICS tour, she was in the perfect position to launch her campaign for the throne - which she absolutely nailed with the release of "Espresso." Once that single came out it was over; she created the song of the summer, an unbelievably catchy and loved song that everyone, I mean EVERYONE, was singing. Every move she made after that brought her into an even brighter spotlight and allowed her to take the throne and secure the title. Her album "Short n' Sweet," the tour, marketing, Grammy nomination and win all cemented this title. Every move from her and her team was so strategic and done so incredibly well, making the foundation for her claim to the Pop Princess title unshakable.</p>

        <span class="bold-text">Olivia Rodrigo: the GUTSY-PUNK POP PRINCESS</span><p>As probably one of the first people you think of when you hear the term Pop Princess, Olivia’s held the title for quite a while now. She had a meteoric rise to the top with her debut album and has unwaveringly held the Pop Princess title ever since. Her beginnings in stardom mirror Sabrina’s, as they both starred in Disney Channel shows allowing for them to collect a fanbase and general recognition before going full Pop-star. Olivia perfectly created her slightly gutsy/punk pop persona from the get go and has stuck with it. Her Pop Princess ascent was definitely unique as it was given almost immediately after her foray into music. “Driver’s License” struck a chord with millions and became one of the most celebrated debut singles of all time. Her debut album "Sour" had the same effect and gained her a loyal base of listeners and permanent position in the Pop Princess discussion.

        <span class="bold-text">Chappell Roan: the TECHNICOLOR DREAM POP PRINCESS</span><p>Lollapalooza was Chappell’s POP PRINCESS era, while she is still so relevant and incredible, that point in time was when she really claimed the throne and title of Pop Princess. She’s brought the theatrics back to the pop scene reminiscent of the over the top performances of the greats like Lady Gaga and Britney Spears. Her outfits and costumes are always full of drama and technicolor dreams.

        <span class="bold-text">Dua Lipa: the DISCO-CLUB POP PRINCESS</span><p>With infectious hit after hit, Dua Lipa has consistently provided pure dance pop tracks for clubs all over. With heavy influence from the Disco era of the 80s and electro pop/house, Dua effortlessly crafts music that fits her effortlessly cool girl pop persona. In addition to supplying club anthems, Dua has really played the role of Pop Princess perfectly and forayed into the fashion space beautifully. Her brand partnerships with Puma, YSL, and Versace give her a multifaceted role in the industry. More than just one off collaborations, Dua embodies the brands and campaigns she’s given making her a lasting figure of the music and fashion industries.
        </p>
    </br>This list could go on and on and on, but focusing on a few of the Pop Princesses of recent years gives a sense of the current era of pop music we are in. One where being unabashedly bold and unique is more accepted than the time our more veteran Pop Princesses experienced in earlier years when their Pop Princess spotlights were inundated with controversy and hate over them being themselves.</br>
    </br>While many talented women have come and claimed the Pop Princess title over the years, what really makes a Pop Princess a Pop Princess is their ability to foster a sense of relatability through their music while touching many with their art, something a title, crown, or throne would never be able to compare to.
