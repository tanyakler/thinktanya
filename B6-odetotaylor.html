        <p>It’s been a long time coming…</br>
        </br>In honor of a certain Sagittarius's 34th birthday, it feels only fitting for me to share my ode to the woman, the myth, the legend herself, Taylor Swift.</br>
        </br>My initial encounters with Taylor and her music date back to elementary school. After school, I would watch her music videos on YouTube, captivated by the stories she told through her songs. The Grammy moment where she sang “Mean” had a lasting impact on me, especially when she changed the lyrics to “someday I'll be singin' this at the Grammy's.” I witnessed the infamous 2009 VMAs incident and was filled with as much rage as an 8-year-old could muster. Despite not yet considering myself a true Swiftie, Taylor's influence on me was unmistakable. Embodying grace and poise in every interview, TV appearance, and headline, she became my role model. As a pre-double-digit-aged girl, I was in awe of her innate sparkle. She was everything I wanted to be: talented, pretty, and kind, all while following her dreams.</br>
        </br>My transition into becoming a true fan occurred between “Speak Now” and “Red.” Following the release of “Speak Now,” I found myself increasingly drawn to her music and captivated by her artistry. There was nothing I didn't appreciate about her or her music. It just felt right to wholeheartedly embrace her, proudly identifying as a Swiftie alongside other girls in my school. The release of “Red” marked one of the most thrilling weeks of my childhood. The anticipation, buzz, and frenzy surrounding its launch were exhilarating. Nearly every store I visited had dedicated displays or entire aisles for the release. Taylor had a full TV appearance lineup. It truly was a remarkable time to be a Taylor Swift fan.</br>
        </br>“Red” was the first album release that I was a true fan for and the first album that I fell head over heels in love with. Even now, “Red” remains my favorite among her discography, with the title track, “Red,” holding a special place as my favorite song of hers. At that time, I couldn't fathom Taylor surpassing the fervor of her “Red” release. How could she get any bigger than she was right now? </br>
        </br>Fast forward two years to the “1989” era. I heard the debut of her lead single “Shake it Off” on the radio while driving back from a roadtrip to Virginia with my family. he anticipation of another album release during her full transition into pop had me buzzing with excitement. The actual release exceeded my wildest predictions—Taylor was everywhere. I couldn't wrap my head around her level of fame. Everything she touched seemed to turn to gold, and the album solidified her status as my all-time favorite singer. When everything seemed too good to be true for her, things took a turn.</br>
        </br>It's funny how a single leaked phone call, one that I neither made nor received, could manage to leave such a mark on me. Out of the blue, I found myself not surrounded by folks wanting to sing Taylor's praises, but instead, by those aiming to tear her down. I kept finding myself in the same debates with friends, tirelessly defending Taylor. Witnessing the shift from adoration to condemnation in the media provided a poignant glimpse into society's tendency to tear down those it once celebrated.</br>
        </br>Throughout this whole ordeal, I wasn't a kid anymore; I was 16. I knew people could be scheming, conniving, and just plain low. I just never expected that force to be directed at someone who, in my eyes, had been on top of the world—a true champion of my childhood, someone seemingly untouchable.</br>
        </br>From the ashes she rose, not as a phoenix, but as a snake. Taking that very symbol people used to tarnish her and turning it into a weapon to reclaim her reputation—it just proved to me that picking Taylor as my childhood role model was the right call. The resilience she displayed and the power she reclaimed during her “Rep” era taught me a lesson: never let anyone dictate who you are. So, as a 17th birthday present, “Reputation” became another life lesson from Taylor, packed into a sonically perfect album. Like a snake shedding its “good girl” skin tied to her earlier work, Taylor emerged, this time, dark and vengeful.</br>
        </br>From this point on, Taylor’s music was sacred to me. I discovered life lessons in each of her songs, continually finding new insights as I grew older and faced new milestones. The release of “Lover” couldn't have been more perfectly timed, coinciding with me moving to Boston and starting college. During those initial weeks of college when all I craved was the familiarity of home, Taylor was my anchor. It felt as if she held my hand, guiding me to class just like my mom did in kindergarten. Of course, she wasn't physically there; instead, I found solace through listening to “Paper Rings” and “It's Nice to Have a Friend.” My transition into college life would have been a lot tougher had it not been for that album. </br>
        </br>At the height of the pandemic, after enduring months of isolation at home and teetering on the brink of insanity, Taylor surprised us all with “Folklore.” In those bleak times when a glimmer of hope was hard to find, Taylor once again became my beacon. I clung to this album as if it were a life raft, a lifeline in the midst of uncertainty. The impact “Folklore” had on me was unlike anything I had experienced before. For days on end, all I could do was listen to the album and cry. Music had never had that much of an impact on me. </br>
        </br>I can honestly say “Folklore” changed my life. I felt a spark of inspiration that I hadn't had for so long. If, in these challenging times, Taylor could do what she loves and create a whole album, what was stopping me from doing what I love and creating things too? As a musician, Taylor has the innate drive to write songs, sonically tell a story, and create a visual world to house those stories and songs. She showed me that no matter how dark the world may seem, as a creator, you always have the ability to make something you can be proud of.</br>
        </br>After surviving the tumultuous year of 2020, with the help of “Folklore” and its sister album “Evermore,” 2021 ushered in a welcomed new era. With the sale of Taylor's masters, I once again found myself engaged in arguments with friends, fervently defending Taylor above all else. Concerns about falling back into the same cycle as before arose, but once again, Taylor rose above it all, coming out stronger than ever.</br>
        </br>The first time I heard “Love Story (Taylor’s Version),” I was uncontrollably sobbing while brushing my teeth. Experiencing a song so nostalgic of my youth, sung by a grown-up Taylor, was emotional, to say the least. The re-recordings offered me the chance to relive the excitement and wonder that accompanied her releases during my childhood, but this time, knowing it was in celebration of Taylor rightfully owning her art—once again taking back her narrative. </br>
        </br>The release of “Red (Taylor’s Version)” was one of the most magical weeks of my life. As a die-hard “Red” girl, this re-release was highly anticipated by me. It just so happened, in true Taylor fashion, that it coincided perfectly with my 21st birthday weekend. The excitement of that week—listening to my all-time favorites with Taylor's grown-up vocals, hearing new vault tracks for the first time, experiencing a 10-minute version of one of her most heartbreaking songs, accompanied by a short film, SNL performance, and the whirlwind of my birthday weekend with friends from home visiting, planning and enjoying my birthday party, and savoring the feeling of finally turning 21—was a lot to take in. I distinctly remember hearing the first chords of “Red (Taylor’s Version)” and being astounded that a song that was already so perfect could somehow get even better. Or hearing the new verses of “All Too Well” in the 10-minute version, especially the line that almost sent me into cardiac arrest: “It’s supposed to be fun, turning 21.” Did I mention it was my 21st birthday?</br>
        </br>The following year, I embarked on a new adventure by moving to Los Angeles for a 6-month co-op at a marketing agency in the entertainment industry. Having never been to LA and not knowing a single soul there, I took the plunge and set up shop for the second half of the year. This marked a significant life change for me, an era where I experienced a lot of growing pains. When I felt like homesickness and missing my friends was going to swallow me whole, Taylor was right there by my side, cheering me on in spirit with the release of “Midnights.” Having a new Taylor album to cling to, as I had done so many times in the past, served as a reassuring reminder that everything would be okay because there was new Taylor music coming—a whole new set of songs to resonate with and learn from.</br>
        </br>After the commencement of The Eras Tour and witnessing the level of her fame skyrocket to heights I didn't even know were possible this past year, I can proudly say I knew it all along. I placed my faith in the right person as a 9-year-old. That sparkle I saw in her is still there, and now everyone else can see it too. Her status has surpassed the label of a superstar—she is mythic.</br>
        </br>Throughout my entire life experience alongside Taylor and her music, whenever sadness, loneliness, loss, or helplessness crept in, Taylor seemed to be there to offer solace. Countless times, I'd find myself in such moments, and suddenly, it felt like someone was wrapping me in a hug, stroking my hair, and assuring me that everything would be fine. Except, that wasn't exactly what was happening. In reality, a Taylor song had come on, immediately bringing me relief, nostalgia, joy, and hope. Like medicine or magic, her music acted as a remedy for any emotional ailment I faced, a constant reminder that, regardless of circumstances, Taylor and her music were there to help me through it all.</br>
        </br>This is how I have lived my life. Any hardship or heartbreak, confusion about my purpose, feelings of numbness, defeat, or anger have all been at least slightly remedied by Taylor Swift’s music. On the flip side, every celebration has been made sweeter, every good day even better, and every happy moment momentously happier with her music as the soundtrack to my life. And for that, I don’t know how someone could ever express the extent of their gratitude.</br>
        </br>Long story short, I survived. I weathered every obstacle and hurdle I encountered in the past, and I owe it all to you, Taylor. I am eternally grateful for you and your music, unable to fathom the person I would be or the world without your music. Thank you, Taylor. I love you. Happy Birthday.</br>
