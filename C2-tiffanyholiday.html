        <span class="concept-subtitle">a marketing concept featuring Leighton Meester and Ed Westwick </span>
    </div>
    <section class="concept-body">
        <p></br>The holiday season is a magical and nostalgic time, offering brands a wonderful opportunity to create enchanting campaigns that add to the festive wonder. This concept for Tiffany and Co. merges iconic characters with the whimsy and magic of the season. As a nod to the beloved TV show, Gossip Girl, the campaign reunites one of its most iconic couples, Blair and Chuck, on the familiar streets of New York City. Set against the backdrop of Tiffany's dazzling holiday displays with ballerinas bringing their magic to the streets, the campaign captures the essence of romance and luxury, infusing the air with the enchantment of the season. As the actors reunite under the twinkling lights of the city, Tiffany's becomes the magical setting for an unforgettable celebration of love and sophistication. This campaign not only pays homage to the allure and nostalgia of Gossip Girl but also weaves the timeless charm of Tiffany's into the holiday tapestry, creating a memorable and festive experience for audiences.</p>
        <p></br><span class="bold-text">WHERE: </span> NYC on a snowy night.</p>

        <p></br><span class="bold-text">WHO: </span> Leighton Meester & Ed Westwick</p>
            
        <p></br><span class="bold-text">WHAT: </span>  Nostalgic holiday promo video set in NYC to bring people to Tiffany's for the holidays.</p>
        
        <p></br><span class="bold-text">SYNOPSIS: </span>  Leighton's character is on an apartment stoop that's decorated for the holidays. It's important to note that this character is NOT Blair Waldorf. While that assumption may be drawn when Ed Westwick is shown, we want the nod to Gossip Girl to only be at the reunion of these two actors and the setting of NYC. It's nighttime and lightly snowing. People are milling about, holiday decorations and lights adorning the streets, and Leighton is just enjoying the scene. Out of nowhere, a ballerina appears in front of Leighton and starts dancing to "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" from The Nutcracker. Leighton looks around, but no one else seems to notice. More dancers appear, and they all continue dancing to Swan Lake in their full ballet costumes. Leighton is confused but intrigued. They begin to dance away from her, so Leighton follows. They lead her, all while dancing to Tchaikovsky, to a Tiffany store. The dancers all retreat into the store, and when the crowd of them is gone, Ed Westwick's character is there waiting outside the store for her with a Tiffany bag in hand. They share a smile, and he presents her the gift: a Tiffany bracelet (or necklace). He puts it on her, and they share a smile and embrace. The ballet dancers all watch from the windows inside the store, and one of them winks at the camera before the screen cuts to black, and the Tiffany logo and tagline appear.</p>
