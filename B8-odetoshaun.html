        <p>Growing up, my family wasn't exactly what you'd call a "sports household." Beyond supporting The Philadelphia Eagles, we didn't rally around any particular team, and sports seasons unfolded without disturbing our cortisol levels. However, one thing we undeniably were—a family devoted to the Olympics. Every two years, you'd find us firmly planted on the couch for a solid two weeks, marveling at the extraordinary feats of human excellence.</br>
        </br>I’ve always viewed The Olympics as one of the grandest and most extraordinary spectacles on earth—a global celebration that unites the world in awe of human achievement. Across borders, languages, and cultures, the Olympics showcase the universal elements of triumphs and tribulations, blood, sweat, and tears, and pure heroic victories that embody the indomitable human spirit.</br>
        </br>While I enjoy watching any Olympic event, my all-time favorites include swimming, beach volleyball, gymnastics, ice skating, and, above all, snowboarding. Fond memories are etched in my mind of my mom and me perched in front of the TV, passionately cheering on our favorite athlete, "the flying tomato," as he continuously made history on the halfpipe. Shaun White's final run in Pyeong Chang in 2018 stands as the record for the longest I've ever held my breath. From his entrance into the halfpipe to the flawless execution of his final jump, not a soul stirred in my house—we didn't even blink. When Shaun clinched that gold medal, securing redemption after his upset in Vancouver four years prior, the indescribable joy and pride I felt were beyond words.</br>
        </br>Even in the face of a disappointing loss in his final games in Tokyo, the unmistakable feeling of pride persisted. When he missed the landing on a jump, cutting short his final chance at Olympic Gold, the collective reaction exceeded that of a single performance. It was a poignant reflection of his entire career. His impact on the sport and his legacy as the GOAT were not lost on any spectators or athletes. In a heartfelt display of gratitude and support, they honored him with an emotional tribute, underscoring the profound impact Shaun White has left on the world of snowboarding.</br>
        </br>Shaun has been an idol of mine for as long as I can remember. I’ve eagerly awaited every Winter Olympics for his events and keep up with his personal creative endeavors, such as his Air + Style festival and his personal brand Whitespace. It's evident how much of his heart and soul he pours into everything, from conquering the slopes to building his personal brand.</br>
        </br>His unwavering love for the game has been a tremendous source of inspiration for me over the years. In my Typography 2 class at Northeastern, Shaun served as the muse for my Typographic Elements poster—a project that remains one of my favorites from my academic journey. During high school, as a member of the class cabinet, I reached out to him via Instagram, asking if he could record a video announcing my Winter Olympics theme for the Winter Ball, the biggest dance of the school year. His video response and the final setup of the dance surpassed my wildest dreams, serving as a constant reminder to myself that, no matter how impossible or crazy an idea or dream may seem, you owe it to yourself to chase it until it becomes your reality.</br>
        </br>From watching him soar through the air on the screen, revolutionizing the face of snowboarding, to witnessing his ventures into creative realms through his new brand, Shaun has been a guiding force behind some of my most significant creations. I owe much of my tenacity, drive, and determination to him and am proud to consider him my idol. Even though Shaun's Olympic days are behind him, his legacy on the halfpipe endures, and he will undoubtedly continue to inspire myself and countless others, wherever the future may lead him.
