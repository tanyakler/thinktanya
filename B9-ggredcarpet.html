        <p><span class="bold-text"> Taylor Swift in Gucci: </span> Starting off strong with the queen herself, Taylor stunned in a simple but gorgeous shimmering green Gucci gown swiftly earning a spot among my personal favorites of her fashion repertoire. Opting to skip the necklace, a trend that we’ve seen quite often in recent award shows, Taylor instead wore dazzling dangling earrings to complement her glittery ensemble. While the shade of green may appear simply striking to the untrained eye, those within the fanbase recognize its deeper significance. With two albums yet to be rerecorded, every move Taylor makes, including her fashion choices, is scrutinized for cryptic clues about her next musical venture. The verdant hue could call back to her debut era, for which bright green was the symbolic color, or it might be a subtle nod to the snake imagery synonymous with the reputation era. Which was Taylor channeling for her look? I guess only time will tell. Maybe her Grammy’s look will provide some real answers.</p>

        <p><span class="bold-text"> Margot Robbie in Giorgio Armani: </span> At a spectacle to honor the film an tv feats, it only makes sense to highlight the star of one of the most anticipated and talked-about films of the past year. Throughout the <em>Barbie</em> promotional tour, we witnessed our real-life Barbie, Margot Robbie, paying homage to iconic Barbie looks at every premiere. The Globes were no exception, as Margot flawlessly recreated the outfit of Super Star Barbie from 1977, down to the last detail. She wore a sequined hot pink v-neck number with a matching tulle boa. While also ditching the necklace for the look, Margot opted for a pair of diamond studs to add to the glitzy and glamorous vibe of Super Star Barbie. She even seamlessly transitioned into the nighttime Super Star Barbie look, donning an identical black dress for the afterparty.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text"> Dua Lipa in Schiaparelli: </span> Dua Lipa consistently dazzles with her showstopping red carpet ensembles, and this time was no exception. Embracing her inner mermaid reminiscent of her aquatic character in <em>Barbie</em> she graced the event in a velvet Schiaparelli gown. The gown's voluminous bustle skirt artfully mimicked the silhouette of a mermaid, adding a touch of whimsy to the ensemble. In a deliberate contrast to the vibrant and colorful Barbieland, Dua opted for a black gown adorned with gold 'bones' along the body, lending it an edgy and skeletal aesthetic. Completing the look, she donned a matching gold archival Tiffany & Co necklace, dating back to 1962.</p>

Clad in a high-neck structured Prada column gown in pink, complemented by sheer black gloves, a diamond necklace, and a sophisticated updo, Hailee exuded the classic charm of Hepburn's iconic character from <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s.</em> My favorite part of her look was undoubtedly the back of the dress, featuring a bow at the top and a long pink train that elegantly trailed behind her.</p>

The picture of elegance, Carey’s all-black dress featured a dramatic fishtail, ruching along the body, and a contrasting embroidered white bodice at the top. This breathtaking piece was a vivid embodiment of Schiaparelli's iconic style, making it a standout choice for the evening.</p>

        </br>
        In summary, the looks from this carpet exuded a sense of understated elegance. While not venturing into avant-garde territory, the event showcased a collection of beautiful, timeless ensembles some of which will undoubtedly be remembered in the annals of award show couture. If I were to encapsulate the essence of this carpet, I would label it as 'Sequins, sequins, and more sequins.' This makes me wonder: is this the year of sequins? With coquette style reigning supreme and bows gracing every corner last year, could it be time for us to embrace the next mega trend? It's still too early in the year to say, but fingers crossed because this is a trend I can gladly get behind.
