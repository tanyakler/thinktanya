        <p>I know I haven’t posted a blog in a while, but a few recent pop culture moments have caught my attention and inspired me to resurface. There is so much happening across several notable industries, so let’s dive right in.</br>
        
        </br><span class="bold-text">Zendaya’s Loewe Challengers Dress:</span><p> When I saw this red carpet look from the 'Challengers' Premiere in Sydney, I audibly gasped. Now I’m a sucker for a good bedazzled luxury evening gown on a red carpet, but Loewe truly outdid themselves with this Challengers press tour look. Zendaya can do no wrong in my eyes, and the pairing of her with stylist Law Roach is a match so carefully made by the Fashion Gods to grace our lives one iconic look at a time. Zendaya, Law Roach, and Loewe all get a standing ovation from me for what they did on this red carpet. At the very foundation of this look, the effortlessly elegant form of this gown with a deep plunging v and tall slit is so flattering and is enough to take your breath away on its own. But to take it up a notch, not only is the dress a gorgeous and very on the nose tennis lawn green shade, it’s completely bedazzled, matching the heels as well. And the cherry on top is the silhouette of a tennis player hitting a yellow tennis ball across the body of the dress. It’s whimsical, magical, and dare I say, one of my favorite movie red carpet looks I’ve ever seen. My eager anticipation for this movie was already pretty high, but after this look it is at an all time high and I cannot wait to see what this trio cooks up in the future.</p>
        </br><span class="bold-text">Cowboy Carter:</span><p>Let’s take a shift into the music sphere. We really are so spoiled right now with the new music that’s been coming out and will continue to be released this year. BIG year for music, the 2025 Grammys are about to be something else. One recent release stopped me dead in my tracks and if you listened to it too, I bet you felt the same. Now, let me preface this with a crazy statement that I’m deeply embarrassed to share: I was never a huge Beyonce listener. I know. I have always respected her artistry and legacy in the industry and think she is THE Queen of Pop, but I never went out of my way to listen to her music. Until now. On a whim, I decided to listen to Cowboy Carter all the way through and was blown away. I haven’t heard such a beautifully and expertly crafted body of music at this par in so long. Every detail was meticulously thought out and perfectly composed, and it absolutely shows. It’s a marvel, a true revolution in music and the album of her career. The genre defying album full of impeccable tributes to music greats along with real and raw emotion and candor is absolutely in the running for AOTY, where the Grammy’s might finally give Beyonce the moment she deeply deserves and has earned three times over now. Also, in addition to the sonic perfection of the album, the visuals are gorgeous. From the album cover, to the Spotify canvases, to her styling, the visual components of Cowboy Carter definitely hold their own against such a mighty musical feat creating a powerful piece of art in every way, shape, and form.</p>
        </br><span class="bold-text">Dune 2:</span><p>Now in the world of cinema, there’s no way you haven’t heard about this highly anticipated, star studded sequel to one of the more boring films I’ve seen. Yes, you heard me right. I was a Dune 1 hater. It just didn’t charm me. I thought it was lofty, slow, and a little too dense for the amount of plot happening in my opinion. That being said, after watching a YouTube summary of Dune to refresh my memory on the world-building elements that I had previously overlooked, I felt prepared to go into it and experience Dune 2 in the way everyone who had been raving about it had. I was ready to give Dune 2 a fresh slate and ready to be impressed, and boy was I. Two words to describe Dune 2: extremely impressive. This was a feat of cinema in every shape of the word. From the stunning cinematography, to the transcending score, to the stunning portrayals of the characters, the film was otherworldly and did what any good movie strives to: it allowed viewers to fade into the story and world of Dune so effortlessly. Every detail of every frame of the movie was so carefully attended to and the performances by the cast were remarkable. The actors were operating at such a high caliber that it really is a marvel to watch. I didn’t know Austin Butler had that in him.</p>
        </br>
        <p>That’s all for now! These are some of the things that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about recently. I'm looking forward to the debut of the remaining albums and can't wait to watch Challengers. Although, I know that movies like Dune and albums like Cowboy Carter don't come around very often.</p>
