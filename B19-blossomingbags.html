        <p>Spring has almost sprung. From later sunsets and chirping birds to warmer sunshine and blossoming buds, the world is in bloom. Spring brings warmth, cheer, hope, and a newfound will to live if you’ve been battling the brutal Boston winter like I have (often losing physically and mentally to the wind). A sense of communal pride for having survived the gray, dreary months is felt all around as more people frolic about to bask in the glorious colors of spring. However, bringing color and brightness back into our lives isn’t solely reliant upon Mother Earth. Many of us use spring as an excuse to dress a little more technicolor to match the environment around us. This season I hope the vessel through which people really experiment with color is accessories, because they’re what really make an outfit.</p>
        </br><p>My favorite accessory is without a doubt the bag. It's oh so versatile and will set the tone of every outfit making it a pivotal aspect of every closet. I know when thinking of colorful spring bags you might immediately think of the STAUD Tommy bag, which don’t get me wrong, are definitely quite adorable, but there are simply so many smaller brands making the most vibrant and unique pieces that you should check out instead. Here are some of my recent brand discoveries/obsessions that I simply don’t hear people talking about enough:</p>

        <br><a href="https://bagsbymonty.com" target="_blank"><span class="bold-text">MONTY</span></a><p>This sustainable brand embraces a slow and sustainable approach to fashion using recycled nylon for all of their hand made pieces. Every bag in their collection comes in bright striped patterns in any color combo you could think of, making it so easy to find a bag that fits your personality and wardrobe.</p>

        <a href="https://rotunda.co" target="_blank"><span class="bold-text">ROTUNDA</span></a><p>If Monty is a little too boho for you, or you just like a more subtle pop of color you’ll want to check out Rotunda. While they have bags for every occasion, my fav pick for the spring would be their Sant Hobo Bag which comes in 12 different color ways ranging from more subdued neutrals to bright bolds perfect for the season. In addition to their bags, Rotunda specializes in elevated and unique accessories, shoes, and coats that champion elegance through simplicity.</p>

They offer simple yet effective designs for functional pieces that will fit seamlessly into any wardrobe with the endless color options and patterns available. (I seriously cannot stress to you how many options they have, there is simply no way you won’t find one you like - just prepare to be slightly overwhelmed… in a good way.)</p>
