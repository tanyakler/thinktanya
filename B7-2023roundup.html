        <p>As the curtain falls on 2023, it's time to revisit the year's standout moments in entertainment. From captivating narratives to infectious tunes, these are the gems that defined my 2023.</br>
        </br><span class="bold-text">TV SHOWS</span></br>
        </br>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Daisy Jones & The Six: </span> Daisy Jones stole the spotlight, adapting Taylor Jenkins Reid's masterpiece seamlessly onto the screen. Anticipation ran high, especially for a devoted fan like me. Revisiting the novel at the year's start only amplified the experience. The show not only lived up to expectations but lingered in my thoughts long after the final credits. A flawless translation of emotions from page to screen made it the pinnacle of television for the year.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 2: </span> As a devoted admirer of the first season (someone who has watched it 5 times), my excitement soared for the sequel. Returning to Cousins Beach felt like a reunion with old friends, yet the magic I cherished in the initial season proved slightly elusive this time. While very, it didn't quite capture the same level of enchantment of the first season. </li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">XO, Kitty: </span> A spontaneous watch with a friend turned into a delightful surprise. <em>XO Kitty</em>, with no prior expectations, quickly became a binge-worthy experience. Its charm, whether attributed to the impromptu viewing or inherent quality, left me eagerly awaiting the next season. </li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">LOKI Season 2: </span> Amidst Marvel's intricate storylines, <em>Loki</em> remains a standout for me. Initially hesitant about getting too invested, I was pleasantly surprised. Season 2 not only exceeded my expectations but also outshone its predecessor. The intricate plot and its satisfying conclusion left me eager to witness <em>Loki's</em> impactful finale unfold in upcoming movies. </li></br>
        </ol>
        </br><span class="bold-text">MOVIES</span></br>
        </br>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Oppenheimer: </span> Initially overshadowed by my anticipation for <em>Barbie</em>,  a last-minute decision led me to “Barbenheimer,” and I am eternally grateful. <em>Oppenheimer</em> not only claims the title of the best movie of 2023 but stands tall among the best I've ever seen. Christopher Nolan's impeccable direction, coupled with Ludwig Göransson's haunting score, left me in awe and thinking about the film long after the chilling final scene.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Sleepless in Seattle: </span>  While not a 2023 release, <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> secured its place as my all-time favorite rom-com this year. A first-time viewing left me incredulous at having missed such a magical experience for so long. As a rom-com connoisseur, <em>Sleepless in Seattle</em> has all the enchantment and charm that defines all of the classics of the genre.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Tenet: </span> After <em>Oppenheimer</em>. I knew it would be amiss to spend another second keeping myself from Nolan’s other works. <em>Tenet</em> further proved my belief in his movie magic. As expected, I was once again mind-blown by the intricate narrative and visual brilliance. </li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes: </span> A Hunger Games fan since fifth grade, the return of this beloved series to theaters provided one of the most nostalgic and magical cinema experiences of the year. While the film adaptation didn't perfectly align with the brilliance of the book, it added a new layer to the series, creating a nostalgically exciting experience. The use of moments from the original score was haunting and a beautiful tribute.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Saltburn: </span> An impulse watch, more driven by curiosity about people's reactions rather than the plot, <em>Saltburn</em> turned out to be a riveting surprise. While certain parts were uncomfortably disturbing, and I found myself skipping through one such scene, the overall pace, characters, and the reveal at the end made it worthwile and a definite standout of the year. </li></br>
        </ol>
        </br><span class="bold-text">BOOKS</span></br>
        </br>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold-text">The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes: </span> Undoubtedly the best book I read this year, <em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em> initially demanded patience as the first few chapters seemed to drag. Yet, once it found its rhythm, I found it impossible to put down. The final pages left me enraptured, with hands shaking as I eagerly flipped through the concluding moments. It's been a long time since a book had such a hold on me.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Everything I Know About Love: </span> A departure from my typical reads, Dolly's memoir <em>Everything I Know About Love</em> offered a refreshing and honest perspective. The book's structure and variety, while consistently sharing Dolly's story, made for an enjoyable and authentic reading experience.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Eligible: </span> Uncertain about my feelings toward a modern-day retelling of the beloved <em>Pride and Prejudice, Eligible</em> turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Skillfully handling parallels between characters and the overall plot, it seamlessly wove the modern aspect, maintaining its own pulse with mastery. </li></br>
        </ol>
        </br><span class="bold-text">MUSIC</span></br>
        </br>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="bold-text">1989 (Taylor’s Version): </span> In 2023, the year dominated by Taylor Swift, and as a Swiftie, it only makes sense that the rerecording of one of her most iconic albums would be the top album of my year. With the best vault of any rerecord, <em>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</em> is a perfect, skipless album.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">The Show: </span> Niall Horan’s second album, <em>The Show</em>, surprised me with standout songs that became the soundtrack of my year. "Heaven" and "Meltdown" secured spots in my top 5 most-streamed songs, with the latter claiming the no. 1 position. Unanticipated, yet pleasantly enduring, this album exceeded my expectations and became a joyful companion throughout the year.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">GUTS: </span> No sophomore slump here! Olivia Rodrigo's bombshell debut left us eagerly anticipating her next album, and with its release in September, <em>GUTS</em> did not disappoint. Olivia delivered an honest, passionate, and vulnerable collection of songs, creating the perfect soundtrack for heartfelt car sing-alongs.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Little Omens EP: </span> Alfie Jukes blew me away with his first EP. After seeing him pop up on my For You Page on TikTok,  decided to listen to the EP on a whim. What I thought would be a one-time indulgence turned into an addiction. I couldn't resist the continuous replay, making it one of my favorite releases of the year and Alfie a new favorite.</li></br>
            <li><span class="bold-text">Home To Another One: </span> While Madison Beer released a full album this year, the single "Home To Another One" stole the show, emerging as one of my most-streamed tracks. Its allure and impact surpassed the rest of the album, leaving an indelible mark on my music journey in 2023. </li></br>
